                            will not be targeted based on the websites you visit
                            over time and the advertisements you click on and
                            may therefore be less relevant to you and your

                            advertisements. We may convert your email address,
                            telephone number, or other information into a unique
                            value and have these third-party platforms match
                            this unique value with a user on their platform or
                            with other data they may have. This matching enables
